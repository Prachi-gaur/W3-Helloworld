Current TODOs:

* Implement Weather API to update weather dynamically - DONE
* Implement Pexels/Unsplash API to change backgrounds dynamically - DONE
* Small CSS/JavaScript Adjustments here and there
* Display a short message when user enters a listitem, at least on the main page
* Add ES6 import/export to keep code tidy and organized

Optional

* Refine scroll to bottom perfectly?
* Ability to clear all items?
* Ability to edit an item?
* Sticky the modal todo so that the list items dont affect the filter, hide completed and possibly also the "You have X tasks to achieve today"
* When clicking search, ideally it should show the :focus effect as with any other links

Older Edits

Version 0.3: 

* Added a todolist with filter with the help of a tutorial on Udemy.
* Added a modal popup for the todos 

I was thinking we can modify the JS code to suit our needs better because right now its still far from perfect.
